# Flappy Bonk üê¶

This is the very first game I've ever made using Unity! It's a Flappy Bird-like game where you control a cockatiel instead of the classic bird.  

## Gameplay  

- **Controls**: Press `SPACE` to make the cockatiel fly.  
- **Exit**: Since the game doesn't have a proper menu yet (and maybe it never will), you need to press `Alt + F4` to exit the game.  

## How to Play  

1. Download the game executable from the `/Game File` directory.  
2. Run the executable and start playing!  

## Notes  

This is a beginner project, so feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
